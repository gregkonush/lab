description: Provision your workspace and learn the core Proompteng concepts.

Welcome to the Proompteng documentation portal. This guide walks through the
minimum steps required to launch your first environment and connect to the
platform APIs.

## 1. Create an organization

1. Navigate to [app.proompteng.ai](https://app.proompteng.ai) and sign in with
   your company SSO account.
2. Create an organization, then invite your teammates with the appropriate
   roles (viewer, editor, or admin).

> Tip: Organization names show up in audit logs. Use the same casing you
> publish externally so on-call engineers can correlate events quickly.

## 2. Configure environments

Proompteng ships with three environment presets: `development`, `staging`, and
`production`. You can manage them from the **Environments** tab.

- Development enables fast iterations with permissive rate limits.
- Staging mirrors production quotas to exercise integrations before release.
- Production enforces strict limits and requires an approval workflow for
  sensitive operations.

```bash
pnpm dlx proompteng bootstrap --env production
```

Running the bootstrap script creates service accounts, API keys, and the
default observability sinks.

## 3. Connect your stack

When your environments are ready, head to the **Integrations** section and
activate the connectors you need. Each connector page provides a YAML snippet
that you can commit into your infrastructure repository.

```yaml
proompteng:
  workspace: your-workspace-id
  environment: staging
  apiKey: ${PROOMPTENG_API_KEY}
```

The values are safe to render in GitOps pipelines and can be rotated without
redeploying your workloads.

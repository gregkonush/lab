title: Tigresse operator
description: Deploy and operate the Tigresse TigerBeetle controller inside the platform.
---

The Tigresse operator manages TigerBeetle clusters on Kubernetes using
controller-runtime. It handles bootstrapping the start script, wiring
cluster networking, and provisioning persistent storage.

## Installation

Tigresse ships with an Argo CD application definition in this repository.
Apply the manifests from `argocd/applications/tigresse` or register the
ApplicationSet entry to roll it out automatically. The deployment creates:

- the `tigresse-system` namespace
- service account, role, and role binding for reconciliation permissions
- the controller deployment
- the `TigerBeetleCluster` custom resource definition

## Storage

Persistent volumes default to the `longhorn` storage class. Override the
`spec.storageClassName` field on a `TigerBeetleCluster` to opt-in to a
different storage backend.

## Cluster definition

Create a cluster by committing a `TigerBeetleCluster` resource. The
example at `argocd/applications/miel/tigerbeetle-cluster.yaml`
provisions a three replica database with `10Gi` of storage per pod.

# TypeScript HTTP Function

Welcome to your new TypeScript function project! The boilerplate function code can be found in [`index.ts`](./index.ts). This function will respond to incoming HTTP GET and POST requests.

## Local execution

To run locally

```console
npm install
npm run build
npm run local
```

The runtime will expose three endpoints.

- `/` The endpoint for your function.
- `/health/readiness` The endpoint for a readiness health check
- `/health/liveness` The endpoint for a liveness health check

The parameter provided to the function endpoint at invocation is a `Context` object containing HTTP request information.

```js
function handleRequest(context) {
  const log = context.log;
  log.info(context.httpVersion);
  log.info(context.method); // the HTTP request method (only GET or POST supported)
  log.info(context.query); // if query parameters are provided in a GET request
  log.info(context.body); // contains the request body for a POST request
  log.info(context.headers); // all HTTP headers sent with the event
}
```

The health checks can be accessed in your browser at [http://localhost:8080/health/readiness]() and [http://localhost:8080/health/liveness](). You can use `curl` to `POST` an event to the function endpoint:

```console
curl -X POST -d '{"hello": "world"}' \
  -H'Content-type: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080
```

The readiness and liveness endpoints use [overload-protection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/overload-protection) and will respond with `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` with a `Client-Retry` header if your function is determined to be overloaded, based on the memory usage and event loop delay.

## The Function Interface

The `src/index.ts` file may export a single function or a `Function`
object. The `Function` object allows developers to add lifecycle hooks for
initialization and shutdown, as well as providing a way to implement custom
health checks.

The `Function` interface is defined as:

```typescript
export interface Function {
  // The initialization function, called before the server is started
  // This function is optional and should be synchronous.
  init?: () => any;

  // The shutdown function, called after the server is stopped
  // This function is optional and should be synchronous.
  shutdown?: () => any;

  // The liveness function, called to check if the server is alive
  // This function is optional and should return 200/OK if the server is alive.
  liveness?: HealthCheck;

  // The readiness function, called to check if the server is ready to accept requests
  // This function is optional and should return 200/OK if the server is ready.
  readiness?: HealthCheck;

  logLevel?: LogLevel;

  // The function to handle HTTP requests
  handle: CloudEventFunction | HTTPFunction;
}
```

## Handle Signature

The HTTP function interface is defined as:

```typescript
interface HTTPFunction {
  (context: Context, body?: IncomingBody): HTTPFunctionReturn;
}
```

Where the `IncomingBody` is either a string, a Buffer, a JavaScript object, or undefined, depending on what was supplied in the HTTP POST message body. The `HTTTPFunctionReturn` type is defined as:

```typescript
type HTTPFunctionReturn = Promise<StructuredReturn> | StructuredReturn | ResponseBody | void;
```

Where the `StructuredReturn` is a JavaScript object with the following properties:

```typescript
interface StructuredReturn {
  statusCode?: number;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  body?: ResponseBody;
}
```

If the function returns a `StructuredReturn` object, then the `statusCode` and `headers` properties are used to construct the HTTP response. If the `body` property is present, it is used as the response body. If the function returns `void` or `undefined`, then the response body is empty.

The `ResponseBody` is either a string, a JavaScript object, or a Buffer. JavaScript objects will be serialized as JSON. Buffers will be sent as binary data.

### Health Checks

The `Function` interface also allows for the addition of a `liveness` and `readiness` function. These functions are used to implement health checks for the function. The `liveness` function is called to check if the function is alive. The `readiness` function is called to check if the function is ready to accept requests. If either of these functions returns a non-200 status code, then the function is considered unhealthy.

A health check function is defined as:

```typescript
/**
 * The HealthCheck interface describes a health check function,
 * including the optional path to which it should be bound.
 */
export interface HealthCheck {
  (request: Http2ServerRequest, reply: Http2ServerResponse): any;
  path?: string;
}
```

By default, the health checks are bound to the `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness` paths. You can override this by setting the `path` property on the `HealthCheck` object, or by setting the `LIVENESS_URL` and `READINESS_URL` environment variables.

## Testing

This function project includes a [unit test](./test/unit.ts) and an [integration test](./test/integration.ts). Modify these, or add additional tests for your business logic.

```console
npm test
```

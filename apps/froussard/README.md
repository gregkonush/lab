# Froussard Webhook Bridge

Froussard is a TypeScript function that receives webhook deliveries (GitHub issues/comments
and Discord slash commands), verifies signatures, and forwards structured payloads into Kafka
for downstream automation such as Argo Workflows and the Facteur service.

  Tasks --> Sensor[Argo Events sensor]
  Sensor --> Planning[Workflow github-codex-planning]

```

The Argo CD application also provisions the `discord.commands.incoming` Kafka topic so Discord automation can publish into the shared cluster alongside GitHub event streams.

## Runtime Responsibilities

- Validate GitHub `x-hub-signature-256` headers using `@octokit/webhooks`.
- Validate Discord `x-signature-ed25519`/`x-signature-timestamp` headers using `discord-interactions` before parsing the payload.
- Emit the original JSON event (`github.webhook.events`) and publish Codex task payloads in both JSON (`github.codex.tasks`) and structured (`github.issues.codex.tasks`) forms.
- Normalize Discord slash command payloads (command name, options, interaction token, user metadata) and publish them into `discord.commands.incoming`.
- Provision and maintain the `discord.commands.incoming` Kafka topic for Facteur ingestion.
- Surface health checks on `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness`.

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run local
```

The local runtime exposes:

- `POST /webhooks/github` for GitHub event simulation.
- `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness` for probes.

## Deployment Notes

- Environment configuration is provided via the ArgoCD `froussard` application.
- Kafka credentials are mirrored from the Strimzi-managed `KafkaUser/kafka-codex-credentials`
  (reflected into both `kafka` and `argo-workflows` namespaces); a companion secret
  `kafka-codex-username` in `argo-workflows` defines the SASL username consumed by
  Argo Events. Strimzi surfaces the username only inside the `sasl.jaas.config`
  field, so we persist a lightweight static secret to expose it under the `username`
  key that `userSecret.key` consumers expect while leaving Strimzi in charge of
  password rotation.
- The Argo Events sensor in `argocd/applications/froussard/github-codex-sensor.yaml`
  maps CloudEvent payloads into the `github-codex-planning` Workflow arguments.
- Discord slash command signature verification requires `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`. Set
  `KAFKA_DISCORD_COMMAND_TOPIC` to control the output topic for normalized command events.
- The structured stream is configured via `KAFKA_CODEX_TOPIC_STRUCTURED` (defaulting to `github.issues.codex.tasks`).

### Local Deploy Script

- Run `bun apps/froussard/scripts/deploy.ts` to build, push, and deploy. The helper derives `FROUSSARD_VERSION` and `FROUSSARD_COMMIT` from `git describe --tags --always` / `git rev-parse HEAD` and injects them before shelling out to `pnpm --filter froussard run deploy`. If you invoke the pnpm script directly, make sure those two environment variables are set first—otherwise the rollout will fail.
- The script uses Bun Shell’s `$` tagged template literal to execute commands, which safely escapes interpolated values, and `$.env()` to scope the derived environment variables to the deploy invocation.

## Verification Checklist

1. Create a GitHub issue in `proompteng/lab` as the Codex trigger user.
2. Ensure Argo Events produces a Workflow named `github-codex-planning-*` in
   `argo-workflows` namespace.
3. Inspect pod logs to confirm the payload mirrors the Kafka message.

## Codex Automation Image

The Codex planning/implementation workflows use a derived container built from
`apps/froussard/Dockerfile.codex`. The helper script below copies the local
Codex auth (`~/.codex/auth.json`), Codex configuration (`~/.codex/config.toml`),
and your GitHub CLI token into the image before pushing it to the shared
registry.

```bash
bun apps/froussard/src/codex/cli/build-codex-image.ts
```

- Override `IMAGE_TAG` to publish a different tag or registry.
- Provide `GH_TOKEN` explicitly if `gh auth token` is unavailable.
- The resulting image defaults to cloning `proompteng/lab` into
  `/workspace/lab`; override `REPO_URL`, `BASE_BRANCH`, or `TARGET_DIR` at
  runtime as needed.
